As a healthcare provider, you need to be aware of the deadlines for submitting claims to ensure that you get reimbursed for your services. In this article, we will discuss the TMHP timely filing calendar for 2024 and everything you need to know to stay on top of your claims management.<\/p>\n<h2>What is TMHP?<\/h2>\n<p>TMHP stands for Texas Medicaid &#038; Healthcare Partnership, which is a division of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. TMHP manages claims processing for Medicaid and other state healthcare programs in Texas.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Timely Filing Deadline?<\/h2>\n<p>The timely filing deadline is the time frame within which claims must be submitted to TMHP for payment. If a claim is submitted after the timely filing deadline, it will be denied, and the provider will not receive payment.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Timely Filing Deadline for TMHP in 2024?<\/h3>\n<p>The timely filing deadline for TMHP in 2024 is 95 days from the date of service. This means that providers must submit their claims within 95 days of providing the service to the patient.<\/p>\n<h2>What Happens if You Miss the Timely Filing Deadline?<\/h2>\n<p>If you miss the timely filing deadline, your claim will be denied, and you will not receive payment for your services. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if the claim was denied due to an error on TMHP&#8217;s part, you may be able to submit an appeal.<\/p>\n<h2>How Can You Avoid Missing the Timely Filing Deadline?<\/h2>\n<p>The best way to avoid missing the timely filing deadline is to submit your claims as soon as possible. You can also set up reminders or alerts to ensure that you do not forget to submit your claims on time. Additionally, you can use electronic claims submission to speed up the process and reduce the risk of errors.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Consequences of Missing the Timely Filing Deadline?<\/h2>\n<p>If you miss the timely filing deadline, you will not receive payment for your services, which can have a significant impact on your revenue. Additionally, if you consistently miss the deadline, you may be subject to disciplinary action or lose your contract with TMHP.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Managing healthcare claims can be challenging, especially when it comes to timely filing. By being aware of the TMHP timely filing calendar for 2024 and the consequences of missing the deadline, you can ensure that you get reimbursed for your services and avoid any disciplinary action. Remember to submit your claims as soon as possible and use electronic claims submission to speed up the process and reduce the risk of errors.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: What is the time frame for submitting claims to TMHP for payment in 2024?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The time frame for submitting claims to TMHP for payment in 2024 is 95 days from the date of service.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What happens if you miss the timely filing deadline?<\/h3>\n<p>A: If you miss the timely filing deadline, your claim will be denied, and you will not receive payment for your services.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: How can you avoid missing the timely filing deadline?<\/h3>\n<p>A: You can avoid missing the timely filing deadline by submitting your claims as soon as possible, setting up reminders or alerts, and using electronic claims submission.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Australia Calendar with Holidays\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.generalblue.com\/calendar\/2024-calendar-streamlined-with-holidays-portrait-en-au-510x660.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.generalblue.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Download Timeshare Calendar 2022 PNG All in Here\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/storage.googleapis.com\/production-homestead-v1-0-9\/099\/268099\/rsLWnodc\/bb2d267d5820433791be5ab2aa723e38\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>wecan.photobrunobernard.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 year calendar yearly printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blankcalendarpages.com\/printable_calendar\/yearly\/2024-year-calendar-yr3.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>blankcalendarpages.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Monthly Calendar 2024 with Notes Calendar Quickly\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/calendarquickly.com\/calendar\/2024\/monthly-calendar-2024-notes.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>calendarquickly.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"FREE DOWNLOAD &gt; 2024 Calendar Templates &amp; Images\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.tipsographic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/2024-yearly-calendar-with-week-numbers-excel-printable-tipsographic-1024x780.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.tipsographic.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Calendar (PDF, Word, Excel)\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.generalblue.com\/calendar\/2024-calendar-blue-noborder-portrait-510x660.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.generalblue.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Calendar Templates and Images\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.vertex42.com\/calendars\/images\/2024-calendar-with-holidays.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.vertex42.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Printable Calendar 2024 Starting Monday One Year Calendar Template\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.mondaystartcalendar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Free-Printable-2024-Calendar-Excel.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.mondaystartcalendar.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FREE DOWNLOAD &gt; 2024 Calendar Templates &amp; Images from www.tipsographic.com Introduction Managing healthcare claims can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to timely filing.

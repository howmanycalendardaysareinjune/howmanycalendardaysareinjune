With the 2024 school year just around the corner, you may be wondering what the calendar looks like and what changes you can expect.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Cal Poly SLO 2024 Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>The Cal Poly SLO 2024 Calendar is the official schedule of academic and administrative events for the 2024 school year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. This calendar includes important dates such as the start and end of each quarter, holidays, and other significant events.<\/p>\n<h2>Important Dates<\/h2>\n<h3>When Does the 2024 School Year Start?<\/h3>\n<p>The 2024 school year at Cal Poly SLO officially begins on Monday, September 23rd, 2024. This marks the start of the fall quarter and the beginning of a new academic year.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the Quarter Dates?<\/h3>\n<p>The 2024 academic year is divided into four quarters: fall, winter, spring, and summer. The fall quarter runs from September 23rd, 2024 to December 13th, 2024. The winter quarter runs from January 6th, 2025 to March 21st, 2025. The spring quarter runs from March 31st, 2025 to June 13th, 2025. Finally, the summer quarter runs from June 23rd, 2025 to September 12th, 2025.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the Holidays?<\/h3>\n<p>Cal Poly SLO observes several holidays throughout the academic year. The holidays for the 2024 school year include Labor Day (September 2nd), Veterans Day (November 11th), Thanksgiving Break (November 28th to December 1st), Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 20th), Presidents&#8217; Day (February 17th), and Memorial Day (May 26th).<\/p>\n<h3>When are Finals Week and Commencement?<\/h3>\n<p>Finals week for the fall quarter takes place from December 9th to December 13th, 2024. Finals week for the winter quarter takes place from March 17th to March 21st, 2025. Finals week for the spring quarter takes place from June 9th to June 13th, 2025. Finally, the commencement ceremony for the 2024 school year is scheduled for June 14th, 2025.<\/p>\n<h2>Changes for 2024<\/h2>\n<h3>What Changes Can We Expect?<\/h3>\n<p>While the overall structure of the 2024 academic calendar is similar to previous years, there are a few notable changes to be aware of. One of the most significant changes is the start date for the fall quarter, which is slightly earlier than in previous years. This change was made to align the academic calendar with other schools in the California State University system.<\/p>\n<h3>How Will These Changes Affect Students?<\/h3>\n<p>For students, the earlier start date for the fall quarter may mean a shorter summer break. However, it also means that students will have more time to complete coursework before the winter holiday break. Additionally, the alignment with other schools in the CSU system may make it easier for students to transfer between schools or take courses at other campuses.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Cal Poly SLO 2024 Calendar provides a roadmap for the upcoming academic year and is an important resource for students, faculty, and staff. By knowing the important dates and changes for the 2024 school year, students can better plan their schedules and make the most of their college experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Any Questions?<\/h3>\n<p>If you have any additional questions about the Cal Poly SLO 2024 Calendar, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to the university&#8217;s registrar&#8217;s office or academic advising center.

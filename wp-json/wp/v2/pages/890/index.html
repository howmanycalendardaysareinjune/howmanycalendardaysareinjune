However, some users have reported that their events are not showing up on their desktops. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this issue and provide solutions to fix it.<\/p>\n<h2>Reasons Behind the Issue<\/h2>\n<p>There could be several reasons why your Google Calendar events are not showing up on your desktop. One of the most common reasons is that you have not synced your calendar properly. Another reason could be that you have accidentally deleted the events from your calendar. Additionally, your calendar settings may not be configured correctly.<\/p>\n<h3>Question:<\/h3>\n<p>How do I know if my calendar is synced properly?<\/p>\n<h3>Answer:<\/h3>\n<p>To check if your calendar is synced properly, you can open Google Calendar on your desktop and check if the events are appearing. If they are not, you may need to check your sync settings.<\/p>\n<h2>Solutions to Fix the Issue<\/h2>\n<p>There are several solutions that you can try to fix the issue. Let&#8217;s explore some of them:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Check Your Sync Settings<\/h3>\n<p>One of the first things you should do is to check your sync settings. To do this, go to your Google Calendar settings and make sure that your calendar is set to sync with your desktop. If it is not, you can turn on the sync feature and see if that resolves the issue.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Check Your Calendar Settings<\/h3>\n<p>If your sync settings are correct, the next thing you should do is to check your calendar settings. Make sure that your calendar is set to display all events and that the events are not hidden. You can also check the time zone settings to ensure that they are correct.<\/p>\n<h3>Question:<\/h3>\n<p>How can I check my calendar settings?<\/p>\n<h3>Answer:<\/h3>\n<p>To check your calendar settings, go to your Google Calendar and click on the cogwheel icon at the top right corner. Then click on &#8220;Settings&#8221; and navigate to the &#8220;Calendars&#8221; tab. From here, you can view and edit your calendar settings.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Check Your Trash Folder<\/h3>\n<p>If you have accidentally deleted your events, they may still be in your trash folder. Check your trash folder and restore any events that you may have deleted accidentally.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Clear Your Cache and Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>Clearing your cache and cookies can help fix issues with your Google Calendar. To do this, go to your browser settings and clear your cache and cookies. Then restart your browser and see if the issue is resolved.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>If you are experiencing issues with your Google Calendar events not showing up on your desktop, there are several solutions that you can try. Be sure to check your sync and calendar settings, as well as your trash folder. Clearing your cache and cookies may also help fix the issue. If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact Google support for further assistance.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Why are Events on Google Calendar app not showing on\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/storage.googleapis.com\/support-forums-api\/attachment\/message-32239290-10725601987052047706.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>support.google.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Print Iphone Calendar Event Calendar Printables Free Templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/calendarinspirationdesign.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/how-to-copy-google-calendar-events-to-another-google-calendar.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>calendarinspirationdesign.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Add iCal Events to Google Calendar iClarified\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.iclarified.com\/images\/tutorials\/58\/189\/189.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.iclarified.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Google calendar not displaying calendar events; menu won&#039;t open\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/storage.googleapis.com\/support-forums-api\/attachment\/message-21417268-2575010414779699958.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>support.google.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Previous Google Calendar Events Not Displayed School Loop Support\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/schoolloop-supportdesk.zendesk.com\/hc\/article_attachments\/360023436074\/mceclip4.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>helpcenter.schoolloop.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Get Add a Countdown to Your Next Meeting in Google Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.lifewire.com\/thmb\/6t2WHX3w_fdDl8TGUnI2f_cfBlU=\/1084x923\/filters:fill(auto,1)\/google_calendar__051909.png32-5804ed505f9b5805c2ba5a19.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.lifewire.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Short Google Calendar events will stop being 30min entries 9to5Google\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/9to5google.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2020\/07\/google-calendar-events-1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1000\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>9to5google.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"desktop version of google calendar does not show all events for a day\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/storage.googleapis.com\/support-forums-api\/attachment\/message-2598196-14094802541768955538.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>support.google.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Add iCal Events to Google Calendar iClarified from www.iclarified.com Introduction Google Calendar is a powerful organizational tool that helps users keep track of their events and appointments&#8230;. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/890"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=890"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/890\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=890"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

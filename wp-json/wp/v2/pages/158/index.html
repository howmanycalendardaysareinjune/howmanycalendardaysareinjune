Once the app is installed, open it and sign in with your Google account.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Share Your Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>To share your calendar, tap on the three horizontal lines in the top left corner of the app and select &#8220;Settings&#8221;.

You can also choose the level of access they have to your calendar, such as &#8220;Make changes and manage sharing&#8221; or &#8220;See only free\/busy (hide details)&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can I remove someone&#8217;s access to my calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: Yes, you can remove someone&#8217;s access to your calendar by going back to the &#8220;Share with specific people&#8221; page and tapping on the X next to their name.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 4: View Shared Calendars<\/h2>\n<p>To view a calendar that has been shared with you, tap on the three horizontal lines in the top left corner of the app and select &#8220;Settings&#8221;. From there, select &#8220;Add calendar&#8221; and then enter the email address of the person who shared the calendar with you.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can I only view shared calendars on the Google Calendar app?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: No, you can also view shared calendars on other calendar apps that support the iCalendar format, such as Apple&#8217;s Calendar app.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 5: Manage Calendar Sharing<\/h2>\n<p>You can manage your calendar sharing settings by going back to the &#8220;Settings&#8221; page and selecting &#8220;Manage shared calendars&#8221;. From there, you can see who has access to your calendar and change their access level or remove their access entirely.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Will changes I make to my calendar be reflected on the calendars of those I&#8217;ve shared it with?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: Yes, any changes you make to your calendar will be reflected on the calendars of those you&#8217;ve shared it with, as long as they have the appropriate access level.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Sharing your Google calendar on your iPhone can help you stay organized and keep track of important events and appointments. By following these simple steps in 2024, you can easily share your calendar with others and manage your calendar sharing settings.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Share your Google Calendar Valiant Technology Knowledge Base\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thevaliantway.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/calendar-share-1c.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thevaliantway.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How Do I Share My Calendar By Using Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendar.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-9.31.39-AM-1024x624.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.calendar.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Share Your Google Calendar SoftwareKeep\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/api.softwarekeep.com\/media\/nimbus\/helpcenter\/share_calendar.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>softwarekeep.ca<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How To Share a Google Calendar With Others\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/d4y70tum9c2ak.cloudfront.net\/contentImage\/Z_UYrURlISxQYWdo8eXpbsfUZdey1pN1KmTdYcKEndo\/resized.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>vnexplorer.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to share Google Calendar a stepbystep explanation IONOS\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.ionos.ca\/digitalguide\/fileadmin\/DigitalGuide\/Screenshots_2020\/my-calendars-for-sharing.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.ionos.ca<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How To Share a Google Calendar and View Other Calendars\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/images.ctfassets.net\/lzny33ho1g45\/2GOKnXLIxgCKVehKesNNYX\/52211fb8f02f936097996fb744f3ec3c\/Google_Calendar_view_shared?w=1400&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=30&amp;fit=thumb\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>zapier.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Set iPhone Calendar Sharing WhatisMyLocalIP\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/whatismylocalip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/How-to-Set-iPhone-Calendar-Sharing-Featured-Image-1-1536x1235.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>whatismylocalip.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to share events with Calendar for iPhone and iPad iMore\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/larger\/public\/field\/image\/2016\/02\/calendar-iCloud-make-public-screens-01.jpeg?itok=9i8c6549\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How To Share a Google Calendar and View Other Calendars from zapier.com Introduction Are you tired of missing important events and appointments because you forgot to check&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/158"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=158"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/158\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=158"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

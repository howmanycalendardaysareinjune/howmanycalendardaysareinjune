The calendar is subject to change, but it is important to have an idea of what to expect for planning purposes. <\/p>\n<h3>When does the school year start and end?<\/h3>\n<p> The first day of school for students in the MPS district is August 26, 2024. The last day of school is June 5, 2025, barring any unforeseen circumstances or weather-related closures. <\/p>\n<h3>What are the major holidays and breaks?<\/h3>\n<p> There are several major holidays and breaks throughout the school year, including Labor Day (September 2, 2024), Thanksgiving break (November 25-29, 2024), winter break (December 23, 2024 &#8211; January 3, 2025), spring break (March 23-27, 2025), and Memorial Day (May 26, 2025). <\/p>\n<h3>Are there any teacher work days or professional development days?<\/h3>\n<p> Yes, there are several teacher work days and professional development days throughout the school year. These days are typically not school days for students. The specific dates for 2024-25 have not yet been announced, but they will be posted on the MPS website as soon as they are available. <\/p>\n<h2>Why is the school calendar important?<\/h2>\n<p> The school calendar is important for several reasons. First, it allows students and parents to plan vacations, appointments, and other events around school holidays and breaks. It also helps students and parents prepare for important dates, such as exams and parent-teacher conferences. Additionally, the school calendar allows teachers and administrators to plan curriculum and other school-related activities in advance. <\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>What should I do if I have questions about the school calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> If you have questions about the MPS school calendar, you can visit the district\u2019s website or contact your child\u2019s school directly. The school should be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information regarding the calendar. <\/p>\n<h3>What happens if there are weather-related closures?<\/h3>\n<p> If there are weather-related closures, the school district will typically make up the missed days at the end of the school year. If there are multiple closures, the district may need to adjust the school calendar to ensure that students receive the required number of instructional days. <\/p>\n<h3>Are there any changes to the school calendar for 2024-25?<\/h3>\n<p> As of now, there are no major changes to the MPS school calendar for the 2024-25 school year. However, it is important to check the district\u2019s website periodically for updates and changes. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> The MPS 2024-25 school calendar is an important tool for students, parents, and teachers alike. By being aware of the major holidays, breaks, and other important dates, students and parents can plan accordingly. If you have any questions or concerns about the calendar, be sure to contact your child\u2019s school or visit the MPS website for more information. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"School Calendars 2024 25 UK Free Printable PDF Templates 2024\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2024-2025-two-year-calendar-free-printable-pdf-templates-19.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Savanna School District Academic Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/savsd.k12.ca.us\/resources\/uploads\/files\/English 2024-25 Approved School Calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.savsd.k12.ca.us<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"202425 School Calendar 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/school-calendars-2024-25-uk-free-printable-word-templates.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cobb County School Calendar 20242025\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.marietta.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Cobb-County-School-Calendar-2024-2025-681x915.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.marietta.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Dade County School Calendar 202425 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/dade-county-public-schools-calendar-tt9n.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Communications \/ Calendars\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/schoolwires.henry.k12.ga.us\/cms\/lib\/GA01000549\/Centricity\/Domain\/6334\/2024-25 School Calendar - APPROVED - 2-14-22a.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>schoolwires.henry.k12.ga.us<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Instructional Calendar The Classical Academies\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/classicalacademy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Calendar-2023-2024-1159x1500.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>classicalacademy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Neisd School Calendar 202425 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/neisd-calendar-2022-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Savanna School District Academic Calendar from www.savsd.k12.ca.us Introduction The school year 2024-25 is just around the corner, and it\u2019s important for students and parents to be aware&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/268"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=268"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/268\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w5.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=268"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

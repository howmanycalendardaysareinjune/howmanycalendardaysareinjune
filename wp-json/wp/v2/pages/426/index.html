It is based on the cycles of the moon and is believed to have been in use since the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE). In 2024, the Chinese calendar will mark the Year of the Dragon, which is considered the most auspicious and powerful animal in the Chinese zodiac. <\/p>\n<h3>What is the Chinese Zodiac?<\/h3>\n<p> The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by a different animal. The animals are: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. The order of the animals is based on a legend in which the Buddha called upon all animals to come to him before he departed from Earth. Only 12 animals came, and as a reward, Buddha named a year after each one in the order they arrived. <\/p>\n<h3>What Does the Year of the Dragon Mean?<\/h3>\n<p> The Dragon is the fifth animal in the Chinese zodiac and is considered the most powerful and auspicious. People born in the Year of the Dragon are believed to be confident, ambitious, and successful. The Dragon is also associated with good luck, wealth, and happiness. In Chinese culture, dragons are revered as symbols of power and prosperity. <\/p>\n<h2>History of the Chinese Calendar<\/h2>\n<p> The Chinese calendar has a long and complex history, with many different variations and regional differences. The basic structure of the calendar is based on the cycles of the moon, with each month beginning on the day of the new moon and ending on the day of the full moon.

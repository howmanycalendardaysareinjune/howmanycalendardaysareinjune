It was originally used to mark the days leading up to Christmas and was meant to help children count down the days until the arrival of the big day. The traditional Advent calendar had 24 windows, each with a small picture behind it. As the days passed, children would open each window and count down the days until Christmas.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the Advent calendar is still a popular tradition, but it has evolved to include more than just pictures. Now, Advent calendars come in all shapes and sizes, and they are filled with a variety of small gifts and treats.
